## What's this?

Well, it's not that easy to explain. It is my leisure fun project.
This app shows me (or any other student or teacher of the NIG) where
and when I have to go to which lesson, whether there are substitutions
or I am allowed to continue writing this app because someone does not
show up for class.


## Are there docs?

The documentation can be found in the docs folder. (html & md)  
I hope it's up-to-date.


## When is it finished?

Never.


## Is there an official version in the Appstore?

There will be an official version - at any point in time.
